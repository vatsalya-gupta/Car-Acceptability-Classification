# Car Evaluation Dataset Classification
This is an implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to predict a Car's Acceptability using the Pandas and Scikit-learn libraries. The feature and label names have been added to the data to make it more readable. Iterating over K shows that K = 7 gives the highest possible accuracy.
